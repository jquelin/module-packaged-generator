# ABSTRACT: build list of modules packaged by a linux distribution

1;
__END__

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module will fetch modules available as native linux distribution
package, and wraps that in a sqlite database. This then allow people to
do analysis, draw CPANTS metrics from it or whatever.

Of course, running the utility shipped in this dist will only create the
database for the current distribution. But that's not our job to do
crazy manipulation with this data, we just provide the data :-)
